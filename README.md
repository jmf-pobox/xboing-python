## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
pip install xboing
python -m xboing
```

## ðŸŽ® For Players

### What is XBoing?

XBoing is a blockout type game where you have a paddle which you control to bounce a ball around the game zone destroying blocks with a proton ball. Each block carries a different point value. The more blocks you destroy, the better your score. The person with the highest score wins.

The arena is filled with blocks and other objects. You have a paddle that can move from left to right at the bottom of the arena. You control the paddle so that the proton ball bounces around blowing up blocks and that it does not go past the paddle and out the bottom, much like a pinball game.

XBoing has many features for a simple blockout type of game. Some of them are listed below :

- Over 20 different block types
- 80 pre-designed levels
- Sound support for many systems
- Very colourful - arcade like
- Keyboard and mouse control
- In game instructions
- (originally) Australian Made :-)

To be added:

- Builtin WYSIWYG level editor
- Simple installation
- Detailed manual page

Originally developed for X11 in C, XBoing was designed for speed and fun, with a focus on colorful visuals and responsive controls. This Python port faithfully recreates the original experience while adding modern compatibility.

### Installation & Playing

#### 1. Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install xboing
python -m xboing
```

#### 2. (Optional) Development Install from Source
If you want the latest development version or to contribute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmf-pobox/xboing-python.git
cd xboing-python
pip install -e .
python -m xboing
```
Or use Hatch for advanced development workflows (see below).

### Game Controls

- **J-K-L Keys**: Move paddle left, fire/launch, move paddle right
- **Mouse**: Move left, click to fire/launch, move right
- **Control-Q**: Quit game

### Special Blocks & Power-ups

- **Multiball**: Splits your ball into multiple balls
- **Extra Ball**: Gives you an additional ball
- **Paddle Expander**: Makes your paddle larger
- **Paddle Shrinker**: Makes your paddle smaller
- **Counter Blocks**: Require multiple hits to destroy
- **Death Blocks**: End your current life when hit
- **Black Blocks**: Indestructible, bounce balls away
- **Bomb Blocks**: Explode and destroy neighboring blocks
- **Sticky Blocks**: Make balls stick to paddle

### Project Status

The game is fully playable across all 80 levels, with most core features implemented and tested.

The status and roadmap are as follows:

- âœ… Full conversion of all original XBoing assets (graphics, sounds, levels)
- âœ… Level loading system that reads and displays original level files
- âœ… Block implementation with correct behaviors and effects
- âœ… Scoring and level bonus calculations
- âœ… Paddle movement and control (keyboard and mouse)
- âœ… Ball physics, collision detection, and explosion animation
- âœ… Audio system for event-driven sound effects
- ðŸš§ High score boingmaster leaderboard (planned for v0.5.0)
- ðŸš§ Special power-ups - random elements (planned for v0.5.1)
- ðŸš§ Power-ups requiring randomness (planned for v0.5.2)
- ðŸš§ Random messages from original (planned for v0.5.3)
- ðŸš§ Machine gun mode (planned for v0.5.4)
- ðŸš§ Missing effects (in progress for v0.5.5)
- ðŸš§ Missing keyboard controls and command line arguments (in progress for v0.5.6)
- ðŸš§ Welcome, instructions, and demo screens (v0.6.0-v0.9.0)
- ðŸš§ Editor screen (v1.0.0)

### Asset Management

All asset path helpers resolve to `src/xboing/assets/` and its subfolders. All images, sounds, and levels are loaded from this canonical directory inside the package. Asset conversion scripts in `src/xboing/scripts/` should use this path for input/output.

- Original XPM graphics â†’ PNG format (in `src/xboing/assets/images/`)
- Original AU sound files â†’ WAV format (in `src/xboing/assets/sounds/`)

Assets have been converted  and no further conversions should be necessary unless there is a new feature that uncovers a gap.

### Asset Migration Tools

```bash
# Run tests
hatch run test

# Convert XPM to PNG (for new assets)
python -m xboing.scripts.convert_xpm_to_png --input path/to/image.xpm --output output.png

# Convert AU to WAV (for new sounds)
python -m xboing.scripts.convert_au_to_wav --input path/to/sound.au --output output.wav

# Normalize all audio files in the assets directory
python -m xboing.scripts.normalize_audio

# Fix background images (formatting, transparency, etc.)
python -m xboing.scripts.fix_background

# Fix ball lost sound or related assets
python -m xboing.scripts.fix_balllost

# Search dependencies in the codebase
python -m xboing.scripts.dep_grep <search_term>

# Build standalone executable
hatch run build-exe
```

### Building Standalone Executables

XBoing can be packaged as a standalone executable using PyInstaller:

```bash
# Build the executable
hatch run build-exe
```

This creates a standalone executable in the `dist` directory that can be distributed without requiring Python installation. For detailed instructions and troubleshooting, see [Building XBoing Executables](docs/DISTRIBUTION-PYINSTALLER.md).

### Testing & Quality

- The codebase is designed for maintainability, extensibility, and testability, following modern Python best practices.
- Type hints and docstrings are used throughout for clarity and static analysis.
- All major UI components (score, lives, level, timer, message window) are event-driven, component-based, and have dedicated unit tests.
- The test suite includes both unit and integration tests, covering game logic, event-driven UI updates, and core systems.
- Logging is used for warnings and errors (no print statements in production code).
