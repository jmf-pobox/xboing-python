# XBoing Python Port

A Python reimplementation of the classic XBoing game originally written for X11 in C. This modernized port maintains the gameplay and charm of the original while offering improved compatibility with modern systems.

## ðŸŽ® For Players

### What is XBoing?

XBoing is an addictive breakout-style arcade game featuring:
- 80 challenging levels with unique layouts
- Colorful block types with different behaviors
- Special power-ups and power-downs (paddle expanders, multiball, etc.)
- Lively sound effects and colorful graphics
- Classic arcade-style gameplay with modern conveniences

### Installation & Playing

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xboing-py.git
cd xboing-py

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the game
python src/main.py
```

### Game Controls

- **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Move paddle
- **Space**: Launch ball / Pause game
- **Esc**: Quit game
- **F**: Toggle fullscreen

### Special Blocks & Power-ups

- **Multiball**: Splits your ball into multiple balls
- **Extra Ball**: Gives you an additional ball
- **Paddle Expander**: Makes your paddle larger
- **Paddle Shrinker**: Makes your paddle smaller
- **Counter Blocks**: Require multiple hits to destroy
- **Death Blocks**: End your current life when hit
- **Black Blocks**: Indestructible, bounce balls away
- **Bomb Blocks**: Explode and destroy neighboring blocks
- **Sticky Blocks**: Make balls stick to paddle

## ðŸ’» For Developers

### Project Status

This Python port is currently in active development. Current features:
- âœ… Full conversion of all original XBoing assets
- âœ… Level loading system that reads original level files
- âœ… Block implementation with proper behaviors
- âœ… Basic ball physics and collision detection
- âœ… Paddle movement and control
- âœ… Audio system for sound effects
- âœ… Background cycling between levels
- ðŸš§ Special power-ups and effects (partially implemented)
- ðŸš§ Game state management and transitions
- ðŸš§ Score tracking and high scores

â””â”€â”€ tests/                # Test scripts
```

### Asset Management

The game uses assets from the original XBoing converted to modern formats:
- Original XPM graphics â†’ PNG format
- Original AU sound files â†’ WAV format

Use `scripts/sync_assets.py` to synchronize assets from the original XBoing directory.

### Development Tools

```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest

# Convert XPM to PNG (for new assets)
python scripts/better_xpm_converter.py path/to/image.xpm output.png

# Convert AU to WAV (for new sounds)
python scripts/convert_audio.py path/to/sound.au output.wav

# Sync all assets from original XBoing
python scripts/sync_assets.py
```
