- [x] Add debug feature: Pressing X key during gameplay blows up all blocks and advances to the next level.
- [ ] Refactor SpriteBlock animation system to ensure type safety between list and dict animation_frames (already patched, but consider a more robust design).
- [ ] Fix test suite import errors (pygame and src import issues).
- [ ] Add `pillow` to `[tool.hatch.envs.default.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml` for dev/scripts use.
- [ ] Recreate the dev environment using Hatch (`hatch shell` or `hatch env create`).
- [ ] Ensure VS Code is using the Hatch-managed environment as its Python interpreter.
- [ ] Remove any unused direct dependencies from `pyproject.toml` if found.
- [ ] (Optional) Use `pip-tools` to generate a `requirements.txt` for runtime dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
- [ ] Use `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth for both runtime and dev dependencies.
- [ ] Refactor the audio player module (src/utils/audio_player.py) to remove .au file support, simplify code, and ensure it follows modern Python and project coding standards as per the refactor proposal in docs/AUDIO_PLAYER-refactor.md.
