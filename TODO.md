# TODO.md

- [ ] Add or update tests to assert on log output using caplog.
- [ ] Migrate asset loading and configuration to DI where feasible
- [ ] Update all tests to use injector-based setup, providing mocks/stubs via test modules as needed
- [ ] Refactor background image loading out of GameLayout (src/layout/game_layout.py) into a dedicated asset loader module for stricter separation of layout and asset management.
- [ ] Keep the Project Structure section in README.md up to date with any future directory changes
- [ ] Continue to ensure all new/refactored code is fully type-annotated and documented.
- [ ] Update documentation as further architectural changes are made.
